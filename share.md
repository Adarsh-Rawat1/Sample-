Let’s zero-in on why the JS never actually draws the chart in the browser. We’ll do two things:

1. **Relax our prerender guard** so that we catch the prerender exception and retry on the next render.
2. **Verify** in DevTools that our container `<div>` and the ApexCharts/interop scripts are all present, and even do a **manual render** from the console.

---

## 1) Update your `OnAfterRenderAsync`

In your **ChartBlock.razor**, replace the entire `OnAfterRenderAsync` with this simpler, prerender-safe version:

```csharp
protected override async Task OnAfterRenderAsync(bool firstRender)
{
    if (_needsRender && _pendingOptions is not null)
    {
        try
        {
            // Attempt JS interop—will throw during prerender, but succeed once interactive
            await JS.InvokeVoidAsync("apexInterop.renderChart", elementId, _pendingOptions);
            _needsRender = false;  // only draw once
        }
        catch (InvalidOperationException)
        {
            // prerendering blocked the call—ignore and retry on next render
        }
    }
}
```

This way, on the **first** pass (prerender) we catch the exception, but **as soon** as the browser loads the page and we re-render interactively, the call will succeed.

## 2) Confirm your scripts and container are in the page

1. **View Source**:  Press **Ctrl + U** on your `/charts/Product` (or `/charts/Trade`) page.

   * You should see in `<head>`:

     ```html
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="lib/apexcharts/apexcharts.css" />
     ```
   * And in `<body>` **after** `blazor.web.js`:

     ```html
     <script src="lib/apexcharts/apexcharts.min.js"></script>
     <script src="lib/apexcharts/apexInterop.js"></script>
     ```
2. **Elements tab**: Open DevTools → Elements → search for your chart container:

   ```html
   <div id="chart_ProductMarkets" ...></div>
   <!-- or -->
   <div id="chart_TradeTools" ...></div>
   ```

   If you don’t see it, there’s a mismatch in `elementId => $"chart_{Definition.ChartId}"`.

---

## 3) Try a manual render in the console

With your network tab still open:

1. Switch to the **Console**.
2. Paste:

   ```js
   console.log("ApexCharts =", typeof ApexCharts, "apexInterop =", typeof apexInterop);
   ```

   You should see:

   ```
   ApexCharts = function
   apexInterop = object
   ```
3. Now paste:

   ```js
   apexInterop.renderChart(
     "chart_ProductMarkets",
     {
       chart: { id: "chart_ProductMarkets", type: "bar" },
       series: [{ name: "Test", data: [5,3,9,7] }],
       xaxis: { categories: ["A","B","C","D"] }
     }
   );
   ```

   – if that draws a quick bar chart, your JS side is fine.

### If the manual chart appears

Great—now we know:

* **Scripts** loaded correctly
* **Container** exists
* **Interop** works

The remaining culprit is timing: once we relax our `OnAfterRenderAsync` as above, your code will draw the real `_pendingOptions` exactly once the browser becomes interactive.

### If the manual chart DOESN’T appear

Then there’s still an issue with your script paths or the container ID. Double-check:

* **Paths** in `wwwroot/lib/apexcharts/` match your `<script>` tags
* **Copy to Output Directory** is set on those files so they actually ship
* **elementId** matches the `<div>` in the rendered DOM

---

Do those steps and let me know:

* What you see in **Console** (the types of `ApexCharts`/`apexInterop`)
* Whether the **manual render** works

Once the manual call is proven, the updated `OnAfterRenderAsync` will make your real data charts appear.
